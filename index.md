## About me
Hi lovely person reading this,

I'm Vicky, a non-binary full stack developer with a specialty in front-end development work. I've been on a computer my whole life with my first pc being one built by my amazing parents when I was 18 months old. (I had a big ball for a mouse that looked like a sun. It was fun to hit.) Besides development, I also crochet, knit, write, and play video games like Sims and Minecraft.

Hey, I like making things sometimes those things are really elaborate sim houses that my sims never properly appreciate. 

## What this blog is
This blog is going to be a place where I share my dev experience.
